# Supress extraneous execution cruft by appending the following to each entry
# in the crontab:
#
#   >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# Otherwise the MAILTO address will receive a report for each command run.
# NOTE: That only works for the output of the very last command if there is more
# than one command that generates output. That's when you need to use braces...
#
# Use rounded brackets to group output of commands:
#
#   (cat ~/log/space && echo && df -h)
#
# Otherwise only the output of the last command will be suppressed from getting
# mailed to you.
